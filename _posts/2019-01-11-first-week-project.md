# MTA turnstile data

My first project at Metis was focused on analyzing data from the MTA turnstile dataset. I worked with a team of two others to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.

## The Goal

The fictional client was WomenTechWomenYest (WYWT), a non-profit with a mission of increasing the representation of Women in the Tech industry. They have a gala coming up in early summer for which they will street teams out to the entrance of subway stations in order to solicit attendees to the event.

## The Plan

We decided to focus on identifying which stations were the busiest, then finding the busiest days for those stations. This was our MVP (Mininum Viable Product). The most obvious actionable piece of information that the data could tell us is where the most foot traffic would be located. If we could identify the location and date of said traffic, then an immediate reccomendation would be to send your teams there on that date.

If we achieved our mininum viable product, then we planned on searching for demographic information that would be useful to the mission of WYWT. The goal for the gala we assumed would be to raise awareness of and funds for the organization. The demographic groups that WTWY would want to reach in that case would be women and high-income people.
